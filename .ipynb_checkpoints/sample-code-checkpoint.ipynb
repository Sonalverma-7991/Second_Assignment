    "String Slicing in Python\n",
    "String slicing is a technique in Python to extract a portion (substring) of a string. It is done using the colon (:) operator inside square brackets ([]). The basic syntax for slicing is:\n",
    "\n",
    "string[start:stop:step]\n",
    "start: The index where the slice starts (inclusive). If omitted, it defaults to 0.\n",
    "stop: The index where the slice ends (exclusive). If omitted, it defaults to the length of the string.\n",
    "step: The step value, which determines how much to increment the index by after each step. If omitted, it defaults to 1.\n",
    "Examples of String Slicing\n",
    "Basic Slicing:\n",
    "\n",
    "s = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "print(s[0:5])  # Output: 'Hello'\n",
    "This extracts the substring from index 0 to 4 (up to but not including 5).\n",
    "\n",
    "Omitting Start and Stop:\n",
    "\n",
    "s = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "print(s[:5])  # Output: 'Hello'\n",
    "print(s[7:])  # Output: 'World!'\n",
    "If start is omitted, slicing begins from the start of the string. If stop is omitted, slicing continues to the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Negative Indexing:\n",
    "\n",
    "s = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "print(s[-6:-1])  # Output: 'World'\n",
    "Negative indices count from the end of the string. -1 is the last character, -2 is the second last, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Step:\n",
    "\n",
    "s = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "print(s[::2])  # Output: 'Hlo ol!'\n",
    "The step value 2 skips every other character.\n",

    "Reversing a String:\n",
    "\n",
    "s = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "print(s[::-1])  # Output: '!dlroW ,olleH'\n",
    "A negative step value (-1) can be used to reverse the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Practical Uses of String Slicing\n",

    "2.Explain the key features of lists in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, lists are one of the most commonly used data structures. Here are the key features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ordered Collection\n",
    "Lists maintain the order of elements. When you add items to a list, they remain in the order in which they were inserted.\n",
    "2. Mutable\n",
    "Lists are mutable, meaning you can change their content (add, remove, or modify elements) without creating a new list.\n",
    "3. Dynamic Size\n",
    "Lists in Python can grow and shrink dynamically as elements are added or removed.\n",
    "4. Heterogeneous Elements\n",
    "A list can contain elements of different data types, such as integers, strings, floats, or even other lists.\n",
    "5. Indexed Access\n",
    "Elements in a list can be accessed using indices. The index of the first element is 0, the second is 1, and so on. Negative indexing is also supported, where -1 refers to the last element.\n",
    "6. Slicing\n",
    "Lists support slicing, allowing you to access a subset of the list using a range of indices.\n",
    "7. Built-in Methods\n",
    "Python lists come with a variety of built-in methods like append(), extend(), insert(), remove(), pop(), sort(), reverse(), and more, which provide powerful ways to manipulate list data.\n",
    "8. Supports Iteration\n",
    "Lists can be easily iterated over using loops, making them very versatile for tasks involving repeated operations on elements.\n",
    "9. Variable Nesting\n",
    "Lists can contain other lists as elements, allowing for the creation of multi-dimensional lists (like matrices).\n",
    "10. Memory Allocation\n",
    "Lists are allocated in memory with some extra space, allowing them to grow efficiently without needing to frequently reallocate memory.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "# Creating a list\n",
    "my_list = [1, 'apple', 3.14, [5, 6, 7]]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing elements\n",
    "print(my_list[1])  # Output: 'apple'\n",
    "\n",
    "# Modifying elements\n",
    "my_list[2] = 2.71\n",
    "\n",
    "# Adding elements\n",
    "my_list.append('new item')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Slicing\n",
    "print(my_list[1:3])  # Output: ['apple', 2.71]\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, accessing, modifying, and deleting elements in a list can be done in various ways. Below are explanations and examples for each operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Accessing Elements\n",
    "By Index:\n",
    "You can access an element in a list by using its index. Python uses zero-based indexing, so the first element is at index 0.\n",
    "# Example list\n",
    "fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date']\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing the first element\n",
    "print(fruits[0])  # Output: apple\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing the last element\n",
    "print(fruits[-1])  # Output: date\n",
    "By Slicing:\n",
    "Slicing allows you to access a range of elements.\n",
    "# Accessing elements from index 1 to 3 (excluding 3)\n",
    "print(fruits[1:3])  # Output: ['banana', 'cherry']\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing all elements from the start to index 2 (excluding 2)\n",
    "print(fruits[:2])  # Output: ['apple', 'banana']\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing all elements from index 1 to the end\n",
    "print(fruits[1:])  # Output: ['banana', 'cherry', 'date']\n",
    "2. Modifying Elements\n",
    "Modify by Index:\n",
    "You can change the value of an element at a specific index by assigning a new value to that index.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Modifying the second element\n",
    "fruits[1] = 'blueberry'\n",
    "print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'blueberry', 'cherry', 'date']\n",
    "Modify by Slicing:\n",
    "You can modify multiple elements at once using slicing.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Changing the first two elements\n",
    "fruits[:2] = ['avocado', 'blackberry']\n",
    "print(fruits)  # Output: ['avocado', 'blackberry', 'cherry', 'date']\n",
    "3. Deleting Elements\n",
    "Using del:\n",
    "The del statement can be used to remove an element by its index or remove a slice of elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Deleting the third element\n",
    "del fruits[2]\n",
    "print(fruits)  # Output: ['avocado', 'blackberry', 'date']\n",
    "\n",
    "# Deleting the first two elements\n",
    "del fruits[:2]\n",
    "print(fruits)  # Output: ['date']\n",
    "Using remove():\n",
    "The remove() method removes the first occurrence of a specified value from the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Adding elements back for demonstration\n",
    "fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date']\n",
    "\n",
    "# Removing 'banana'\n",
    "fruits.remove('banana')\n",
    "print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'cherry', 'date']\n",
    "Using pop():\n",
    "The pop() method removes the element at a specified index and returns it. If no index is provided, it removes and returns the last element.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Removing and returning the last element\n",
    "last_fruit = fruits.pop()\n",
    "print(last_fruit)  # Output: date\n",
    "print(fruits)      # Output: ['apple', 'cherry']\n",
    "\n",
    "# Removing and returning the first element\n",
    "first_fruit = fruits.pop(0)\n",
    "print(first_fruit)  # Output: apple\n",
    "print(fruits)       # Output: ['cherry']\n",
    "Summary\n",
    "Access: Use indices or slices to retrieve elements.\n",
    "Modify: Assign new values to specific indices or slices.\n",
    "Delete: Use del, remove(), or pop() to remove elements.\n",

    "4.Compare and contrast tuples and lists with examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples and lists are both sequence data types in Python that can store collections of items. However, they have different characteristics and use cases. Below is a comparison of tuples and lists, along with examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Mutability\n",
    "Lists are mutable, meaning their elements can be changed, added, or removed after the list is created.\n",
    "Tuples are immutable, meaning once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# List example (Mutable)\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "my_list[0] = 10  # Modifying the first element\n",
    "my_list.append(4)  # Adding a new element\n",
    "print(my_list)  # Output: [10, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Tuple example (Immutable)\n",
    "my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "# my_tuple[0] = 10  # This will raise a TypeError\n",
    "2. Syntax\n",
    "Lists are defined using square brackets [].\n",
    "Tuples are defined using parentheses ().\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "# List\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Tuple\n",
    "my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "3. Performance\n",
    "Tuples are generally faster than lists because they are immutable and have a smaller memory footprint.\n",
    "Lists are slower in comparison due to their mutability and the need to manage dynamic resizing.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "import timeit\n",
    "\n",
    "# Timing list creation\n",
    "list_time = timeit.timeit(stmt=\"[1, 2, 3]\", number=1000000)\n",
    "print(f\"List creation time: {list_time}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Timing tuple creation\n",
    "tuple_time = timeit.timeit(stmt=\"(1, 2, 3)\", number=1000000)\n",
    "print(f\"Tuple creation time: {tuple_time}\")\n",
    "4. Use Cases\n",
    "Lists are used when you need a collection of items that can be modified, such as adding, removing, or changing elements.\n",
    "Tuples are used when you need a fixed collection of items that should not be modified, such as representing a sequence of values that shouldn't change (e.g., coordinates, database records).\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "# List example: Shopping cart items that can be added to or removed from\n",
    "shopping_cart = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
    "shopping_cart.append(\"date\")\n",
    "print(shopping_cart)  # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date']\n",
    "\n",
    "# Tuple example: Coordinates of a point that should not change\n",
    "coordinates = (10, 20)\n",
    "print(coordinates)  # Output: (10, 20)\n",
    "5. Functions and Methods\n",
    "Lists have many built-in methods like append(), extend(), remove(), pop(), sort(), reverse(), etc.\n",
    "Tuples have fewer built-in methods, primarily count() and index().\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "# List methods\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "my_list.append(4)\n",
    "my_list.remove(2)\n",
    "print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 3, 4]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Tuple methods\n",
    "my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 2)\n",
    "print(my_tuple.count(2))  # Output: 2 (counts occurrences of 2)\n",
    "print(my_tuple.index(3))  # Output: 2 (index of the first occurrence of 3)\n",
    "6. Unpacking\n",
    "Both lists and tuples support unpacking, where you can assign elements to variables in a single statement. However, tuples are more commonly used for unpacking due to their fixed size.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "# List unpacking\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "a, b, c = my_list\n",
    "print(a, b, c)  # Output: 1 2 3\n",
    "\n",
    "# Tuple unpacking\n",
    "my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "x, y, z = my_tuple\n",
    "print(x, y, z)  # Output: 1 2 3\n",
    "7. Nested Structures\n",
    "Both lists and tuples can be nested within each other. However, since tuples are immutable, nesting mutable objects like lists within tuples is a way to include some modifiable data within an otherwise immutable structure.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "# List within a list\n",
    "nested_list = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]\n",
    "nested_list[0][0] = 10\n",
    "print(nested_list)  # Output: [[10, 2], [3, 4]]\n",
    "\n",
    "# List within a tuple\n",
    "nested_tuple = ([1, 2], [3, 4])\n",
    "nested_tuple[0][0] = 10  # Allowed because the list is mutable\n",
    "print(nested_tuple)  # Output: ([10, 2], [3, 4])\n",
    "Summary\n",
    "Mutability: Lists are mutable, tuples are immutable.\n",
    "Syntax: Lists use [], tuples use ().\n",
    "Performance: Tuples are generally faster and more memory-efficient.\n",
    "Use Cases: Use lists for modifiable collections and tuples for fixed collections.\n",
    "Methods: Lists have more methods for modification; tuples have limited methods.\n",
    "Unpacking: Both support unpacking, but tuples are more commonly used.\n",
    "Nested Structures: Both can be nested, but tuples can contain mutable objects like lists.\n",
    "This comparison helps in choosing the right data structure based on the specific needs of your program.\n",

    "5.Describe the key features of sets and provide examples of their use.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a set is an unordered collection of unique elements. Sets are particularly useful when you need to store items without duplicates and perform operations like unions, intersections, and differences. Below are the key features of sets, along with examples of their use.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Unordered Collection\n",
    "Sets do not maintain the order of elements. The elements are stored in an unordered way, which means that the order of elements in a set is not predictable.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a set\n",
    "my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n",
    "print(my_set)  # Output could be {1, 2, 3, 4} or any permutation of these\n",
    "2. Unique Elements\n",
    "A set automatically removes duplicate elements. Each element in a set is unique.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a set with duplicate elements\n",
    "my_set = {1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4}\n",
    "print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4}\n",
    "3. Mutable\n",
    "Sets are mutable, meaning you can add, remove, or modify the elements after the set has been created.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Adding elements to a set\n",
    "my_set = {1, 2, 3}\n",
    "my_set.add(4)\n",
    "print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Removing elements from a set\n",
    "my_set.remove(3)\n",
    "print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 4}\n",
    "4. No Indexing or Slicing\n",
    "Unlike lists and tuples, sets do not support indexing, slicing, or other sequence-like behavior because they are unordered.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Attempting to access an element by index will raise an error\n",
    "my_set = {1, 2, 3}\n",
    "# print(my_set[0])  # This will raise a TypeError\n",
    "5. Set Operations\n",
    "Sets support a variety of mathematical set operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "set_a = {1, 2, 3}\n",
    "set_b = {3, 4, 5}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Union (elements in either set)\n",
    "union_set = set_a.union(set_b)\n",
    "print(union_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Intersection (elements in both sets)\n",
    "intersection_set = set_a.intersection(set_b)\n",
    "print(intersection_set)  # Output: {3}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Difference (elements in set_a but not in set_b)\n",
    "difference_set = set_a.difference(set_b)\n",
    "print(difference_set)  # Output: {1, 2}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Symmetric Difference (elements in either set_a or set_b, but not in both)\n",
    "sym_diff_set = set_a.symmetric_difference(set_b)\n",
    "print(sym_diff_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 4, 5}\n",
    "6. Immutable Sets (frozenset)\n",
    "Python also provides an immutable version of a set called frozenset. Once created, a frozenset cannot be modified.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a frozenset\n",
    "frozen_set = frozenset([1, 2, 3, 4])\n",
    "print(frozen_set)  # Output: frozenset({1, 2, 3, 4})\n",
    "\n",
    "# Attempting to add or remove elements will raise an error\n",
    "# frozen_set.add(5)  # This will raise an AttributeError\n",
    "7. Membership Testing\n",
    "Sets are optimized for membership testing, meaning checking if an element is in a set is very fast.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Check if an element is in the set\n",
    "print(3 in my_set)  # Output: True\n",
    "print(6 in my_set)  # Output: False\n",
    "8. Efficient for Removing Duplicates\n",
    "Sets are often used to remove duplicates from a list or other iterable.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Removing duplicates from a list\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]\n",
    "unique_set = set(my_list)\n",
    "print(unique_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Converting back to a list\n",
    "unique_list = list(unique_set)\n",
    "print(unique_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "9. Iterating Through a Set\n",
    "Although sets do not maintain order, you can still iterate through the elements using a loop.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Iterating through a set\n",
    "my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n",
    "for item in my_set:\n",
    "    print(item)\n",
    "# Output: The elements will be printed in no particular order\n",
    "Summary\n",
    "Unordered Collection: No guaranteed order for elements.\n",
    "Unique Elements: No duplicates allowed; automatically removes duplicates.\n",
    "Mutable: Elements can be added or removed.\n",
    "No Indexing: Cannot access elements by index or perform slicing.\n",
    "Set Operations: Supports union, intersection, difference, etc.\n",
    "Immutable Version: frozenset is the immutable counterpart.\n",
    "Membership Testing: Efficient for checking if an element exists.\n",
    "Removing Duplicates: Ideal for removing duplicates from a sequence.\n",
    "These features make sets a powerful tool in Python for handling collections of unique items, performing mathematical set operations, and optimizing membership tests.\n",

    "\n",
    "Use Cases of Tuples\n",
    "Immutable Data Storage:\n",
    "\n",
    "Fixed Collections: Tuples are ideal when you need to store a collection of items that should not change throughout the program. For instance, you might use a tuple to store a pair of latitude and longitude coordinates, RGB color values, or database connection parameters.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "coordinates = (40.7128, -74.0060)  # Latitude and longitude of New York City\n",
    "rgb_color = (255, 0, 0)  # RGB for red color\n",
    "Heterogeneous Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "Grouping Different Data Types: Tuples are often used to group heterogeneous data (different data types). For example, in a function that returns multiple values of different types, you can return them as a tuple.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",

    "Dictionary Keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Tuples as Keys: Since tuples are immutable, they can be used as keys in dictionaries, unlike lists. This is useful when you need a composite key made up of multiple elements.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "employee_data = {(\"John Doe\", \"Developer\"): 100000, (\"Jane Smith\", \"Manager\"): 120000}\n",
    "Unpacking:\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple Assignment: Tuples allow for clean and efficient unpacking of multiple values in a single statement. This is especially useful when dealing with functions that return multiple values.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",

    "Set Operations on Large Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimized Operations on Large Data: When working with large datasets, using sets can be more efficient for operations like finding unique elements, duplicates, or performing set operations on multiple datasets.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "large_dataset_a = set(range(100000))\n",
    "large_dataset_b = set(range(50000, 150000))\n",

    "    \"A\": {\"B\", \"C\"},\n",
    "    \"B\": {\"A\", \"D\"},\n",
    "    \"C\": {\"A\", \"D\"},\n",
    "    \"D\": {\"B\", \"C\"},\n",
    "}\n",
    "Permissions and Access Control:\n",
    "\n",
    "Managing Permissions: Sets can be used to manage and compare user permissions or roles, such as determining the permissions a user has by comparing sets of roles and their corresponding permissions.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, dictionaries are mutable collections of key-value pairs. You can easily add, modify, and delete items in a dictionary. Here’s how you can perform these operations with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Adding Items to a Dictionary\n",
    "You can add a new key-value pair to a dictionary by simply assigning a value to a new key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a dictionary\n",
    "person = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Adding a new key-value pair\n",
    "person['city'] = 'New York'\n",
    "print(person)  # Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25, 'city': 'New York'}\n",
    "2. Modifying Items in a Dictionary\n",
    "To modify an existing value, you just need to assign a new value to an existing key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",

    "person['city'] = 'Los Angeles'\n",
    "print(person)  # Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 26, 'city': 'Los Angeles'}\n",
    "3. Deleting Items from a Dictionary\n",
    "There are several ways to delete items from a dictionary:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Using del Statement\n",
    "The del statement removes the key-value pair from the dictionary.\n",

    "\n",
    "# Removing the last inserted key-value pair\n",
    "last_item = person.popitem()\n",
    "print(last_item)  # Output: ('city', 'Los Angeles')\n",
    "print(person)     # Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 26}\n",
    "d. Using clear() Method\n",
    "The clear() method removes all items from the dictionary, leaving it empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Clearing all items from the dictionary\n",

    "8.Discuss the importance of dictionary keys being immutable and provide examples\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the keys of a dictionary must be immutable. This is a fundamental aspect of how dictionaries work, and it is important for several reasons. Let's discuss the importance of dictionary keys being immutable and provide examples to illustrate the concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Hashability of Keys\n",
    "Definition: Dictionary keys must be hashable, which means they must have a fixed hash value during their lifetime. Hashability ensures that the key can be consistently mapped to a specific location in the dictionary's underlying data structure, allowing for fast lookups.\n",
    "Reason: Immutability is required for hashability. If a key could change after being added to the dictionary, its hash value would also change, leading to potential issues in locating the key in the dictionary.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using an immutable key (string)\n",
    "my_dict = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25}\n",
    "print(my_dict['name'])  # Output: Alice\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using a mutable key (list) will raise an error\n",
    "# my_dict = {[1, 2, 3]: 'Numbers'}  # Raises TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'\n",
    "**2. Consistency in Dictionary Operations\n",
    "Definition: Dictionaries rely on the consistency of keys for various operations like lookups, insertions, and deletions.\n",
    "Reason: If a key were mutable and its value could change, it would cause inconsistencies in the dictionary operations. For example, if you modified a key after inserting it into the dictionary, you might not be able to find or access the corresponding value, leading to logical errors.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using a tuple (immutable) as a key\n",
    "coordinates = (40.7128, -74.0060)\n",
    "location_dict = {coordinates: 'New York'}\n",
    "print(location_dict[coordinates])  # Output: New York\n",
    "\n",
    "# Attempting to use a mutable list as a key\n",
    "# coordinates = [40.7128, -74.0060]\n",
    "# location_dict = {coordinates: 'New York'}  # Raises TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'\n",
    "**3. Key Uniqueness\n",
    "Definition: Dictionary keys must be unique. If a key could change, it might violate the uniqueness constraint of dictionary keys.\n",
    "Reason: Immutability ensures that once a key is set, it cannot be altered, which guarantees that the key remains unique within the dictionary.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using integers (immutable) as keys\n",
    "student_grades = {101: 'A', 102: 'B', 103: 'C'}\n",
    "print(student_grades[101])  # Output: A\n",
    "\n",
    "# If keys were mutable, it could lead to issues with uniqueness\n",
    "# student_grades = {[1, 2, 3]: 'A'}  # Raises TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'\n",
    "**4. Performance Optimization\n",
    "Definition: Dictionary operations like insertion, deletion, and lookup are optimized using hash tables, which require keys to be immutable.\n",
    "Reason: The immutability of keys ensures that their hash values remain constant, allowing dictionaries to achieve average time complexity of O(1) for these operations. If keys were mutable, the performance of dictionary operations could degrade significantly.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Efficient dictionary operations with immutable keys\n",
    "employee_ids = {'Alice': 1001, 'Bob': 1002, 'Charlie': 1003}\n",
    "print(employee_ids['Alice'])  # Output: 1001\n",
    "\n",
    "# If keys were mutable, it would complicate these operations and reduce performance\n",
    "# employee_ids = {[1, 2, 3]: 1001}  # Raises TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'\n",
    "Examples of Immutable Keys in Python Dictionaries\n",
    "Strings: Strings are immutable in Python, making them the most commonly used dictionary keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "user_info = {'username': 'john_doe', 'email': 'john@example.com'}\n",
    "print(user_info['username'])  # Output: john_doe\n",
    "Numbers: Integers, floats, and other numeric types are immutable and frequently used as dictionary keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "phonebook = {1234567890: 'John', 9876543210: 'Jane'}\n",
    "print(phonebook[1234567890])  # Output: John\n",
    "Tuples: Tuples can be used as dictionary keys because they are immutable. This is particularly useful for composite keys, where you want to use a combination of values as a single key.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "point_coordinates = {(0, 0): 'Origin', (1, 1): 'Point A'}\n",
    "print(point_coordinates[(0, 0)])  # Output: Origin\n",
    "Summary\n",
    "Immutability Ensures Hashability: Dictionary keys must be immutable to ensure they are hashable, allowing for consistent and efficient lookup operations.\n",
    "Consistency and Uniqueness: Immutability prevents keys from being altered, ensuring the consistency and uniqueness of keys within the dictionary.\n",
    "Performance: Immutable keys enable Python dictionaries to perform efficiently with an average time complexity of O(1) for key-based operations.\n",
    "By ensuring that dictionary keys are immutable, Python maintains the integrity and efficiency of its dictionary data structure, making it a powerful tool for managing key-value pairs in a wide range of applications.\n",
